First freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design exercise.

In the build a tribute page exercise, I had to build a web page about anyone I wanted using only html and css, and I had to include: headings/subheadings, an image with a caption that had to responsively resize relative to the width of its parent element without exceeding its original size, an unordered list with facts about the chosen person, a quote, and a link.

I built a web page about Christopher Lee because he's one of the most interesting people I have read about.
