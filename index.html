        <li> He met Prince Yusupov and the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, the assassins of Grigori Rasputin, shortly after</li>
        <li><b>1939</b> - He witnessed Eugen Weidmann's execution by guillotine, the last public execution performed in France.</li>
        <li><b>1941</b> - He joined the Royal Air Force during World War II until a medical officer diagnoses a failure of his optic nerve and tells him the he wouldn't be able to fly again, so he joined the Intelligence branch of the Royal Air Force, where he fought nazis in North Africa. Later on, he joined Winston Churchill's Special Operations Executive</li>
        <li><b>1946</b> - He retired from the Royal Air Force and decided to pursue acting</li>
        <li>He was one of Ian Fleming’s first choices for the role of Bond because of his World War II experiences</li>
        <li>He is one of the few actors who has portrayed three different Sherlock Holmes characters: Sherlock Holmes, his brother Mycroft Holmes, and Sir Henry Baskerville</li>
        <li><b>1955</b> - Errol Flynn accidentaly cut Lee's hand so badly his finger nearly came off during the filming of The Dark Avengers. Later, Lee cut off Flynn’s wig while Flynn was still wearing it. Flynn stormed off set and refused to come out of his trailer until Lee claimed it was an accident.</li>
        <li><b>1966</b> - He tried to quit Dracula films but studio executives guilted him into returning by stressing how many people could be out of work if Lee stopped playing Dracula so he agreed to star in Dracula: Prince of Darkness but he felt the script was so awful he refused to say any of the dialogue. Hammer decided that it was far more important to have a mute Lee as star as opposed to anyone else, and thus had Dracula hiss and yell through the film.</li>
        <li>He met Tolkien in a pub and Tolkien gave him his blessing to play Gandalf in any future Lord of the Rings movie. </li>
        <li><b>1996</b> - When he heard that Hollywood was going to make the Lord of the Rings trilogy into movies, he took a role in the TV series The New Adventures of Robin Hood as a wizard, so he’d have clear evidence of his ability to be a wizard and play Gandalf.</li>
